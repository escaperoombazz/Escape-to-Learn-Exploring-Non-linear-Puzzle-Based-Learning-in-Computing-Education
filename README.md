# Escape-to-Learn-Exploring-Non-linear-Puzzle-Based-Learning-in-Computing-Education

Escape room-inspired activities are gaining popularity in education due to their immersive and engaging nature. However, most implementations are linear and centrally controlled, limiting their pedagogical depth. While physical escape rooms offer richer experiences, they are costly and impractical to scale.

This project explores a scalable alternative: non-linear, digital or hybrid escape room designs embedded within teaching materials. It addresses student disengagement in higher education by investigating whether playful, puzzle-based formats can enhance engagement, enjoyment, and understanding.

Focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) education, the activity builds on an initial implementation and brings educators together to co-develop, trial, and evaluate this approach. The group will share experiences, analyze data, and produce outputs to assess its pedagogical value. Findings may extend to broader computing education contexts. Thus, Exploring scalable, non-linear digital and hybrid escape room-inspired activities to enhance engagement in AI/ML education. This project investigates playful, puzzle-based formats to improve student experience and pedagogical depth in computing education.
